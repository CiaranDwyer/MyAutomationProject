GIT MERGE CONFLICT CHEATSHEET
==============================

WHAT IS A MERGE CONFLICT?
-------------------------
A merge conflict happens when Git does not know which version of code to keep.
This usually happens when two people change the same line in a file.

Git stops and asks YOU to decide.


WHEN DO MERGE CONFLICTS HAPPEN?
-------------------------------
- git pull
- git merge branch-name
- Pull Requests on GitHub
- When two branches modify the same line


WHAT A CONFLICT LOOKS LIKE
--------------------------
<<<<<<< HEAD
print("Login successful")
=======
print("Login failed")
>>>>>>> feature-branch

HEAD = your current branch
feature-branch = branch being merged

Git is asking which version to keep.


HOW TO RESOLVE USING TERMINAL
=============================

1. Check what files have conflicts:
   git status

2. Open the conflicted file.

3. Decide what to keep:
   - Keep your version
   - Keep their version
   - Combine both
   - Or rewrite it completely

4. Remove ALL conflict markers:
   <<<<<<<
   =======
   >>>>>>>

5. Save the file.

6. Tell Git it’s resolved:
   git add filename.py

7. Finish the merge:
   git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict"


HOW TO RESOLVE USING PYCHARM
============================

1. When conflict happens, PyCharm shows:
   "Unmerged files detected"

2. Click:
   Git → Resolve Conflicts

3. You’ll see 3 panels:
   LEFT   = Your version
   RIGHT  = Incoming version
   MIDDLE = Final result

4. Choose:
   - Accept Left
   - Accept Right
   - Accept Both
   - Or manually edit middle

5. Click Apply / Resolve.

6. Commit:
   Cmd + K (Mac)
   Add message and Commit.


HOW TO DECIDE WHAT TO KEEP
==========================

Ask:
- What was I trying to change?
- Why did the other person change it?
- Which version matches project requirements?
- Should both changes be combined?

You are not limited to choosing one.
You can edit it however you want.


COMMON MISTAKES
===============

- Forgetting to delete conflict markers
- Forgetting to run git add
- Trying to commit before resolving all conflicts

Always check:
   git status


USEFUL COMMANDS
===============

See conflicts:
   git status

Abort merge completely:
   git merge --abort

See commit history:
   git log

Undo everything (dangerous):
   git reset --hard


KEY IDEA
========

A merge conflict is not an error.
It is Git asking:
"Which code should exist?"

You decide.
